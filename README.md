# Students_Detail_App
This is student listing Android app made with Kotlin programming language. 
In this app we store the data of students like name, email and rollno. 
Here I have used room db, recycler view etc. 
With the help of this project, I got to learn how to use "DB browser for sqlite". I used it to check if the data is inserted into the database or not.
